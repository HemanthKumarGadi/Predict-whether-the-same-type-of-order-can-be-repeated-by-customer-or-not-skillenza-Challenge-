# classification model to predict whether the-same type of order can be repeated-by-any-customer or not
Objective: By classifying the different orders, the companyâ€™s research team will understand better insights and research can help them make good decisions on setting prices for customers in different regions. This kind of research also helps companies to understand from which type of customers and in which type of regions the orders can be repeated by customers.   Goal: Given the order transaction details, build a classification model which can predict whether the same type of order can be repeated by any customer or no chance that the same type of order cannot be repeated by any customer.
